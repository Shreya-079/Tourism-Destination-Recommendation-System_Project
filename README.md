# 🌍 Tourism Destination Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Tourism Destination Recommendation System** is a database-driven application designed to help users discover suitable travel destinations based on their preferences. The system stores and manages tourism data efficiently and provides intelligent suggestions by analyzing user interests such as location type, budget, and activities.

This project was developed as part of an academic DBMS project, focusing on the practical implementation of core database concepts like schema design, relationships, queries, and data management.
